Following the approach outlined in the [Tools For Composite Indicators Building](https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC31473/EUR%2021682%20EN.pdf) document prepared by the applied statistic group of the European commission joint research centre, Factor Analysis is being applied to 14 indicators to construct a composite index.<br /><br />
index_df.csv consists of 14 indicators that are most closely associated with Targets 2, 3 and 4 of SDG10 - Reduced inequality from 2000 to 2018 and are used to consturct a composite index to measure equality.<br /><br />
indicators_targets_souces.xlsx groups the indicators into the targets with a brief description of what the indicators are in sheet 1, and groups the indicators by source in sheet 2<br /><br />
\_final_index.csv is the results. It consists of the 14 indicators, the intermediate composite indicators, the final index score as well as the country-year ranking.
